# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend — Project Requirements

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to **identify and document** the key features and functionalities of the **Airbnb Clone Backend**, focusing on the technical and functional requirements necessary for building a **scalable**, **secure**, and **robust** system.

---

## 📚 Introduction

Backend development powers the **server-side logic**, **database management**, and **API integrations** of a web application.  
In this project, we define the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone — highlighting the essential components that make it **functional**, **user-friendly**, and **efficient**.

The requirements are divided into:

- **Core Functionalities**
- **Technical Requirements**
- **Non-Functional Requirements**

---

## 🔑 Core Functionalities

The backend must support all the main operations of a rental marketplace like Airbnb.

### 1. 👤 User Management

**User Registration**
- Allow users to register as **Guests** or **Hosts**.
- Use secure authentication such as **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

**User Login and Authentication**
- Enable login via **email** and **password**.
- Include **OAuth** login options (e.g., Google, Facebook).

**Profile Management**
- Users can update their profiles (photo, contact info, preferences).

---

### 2. 🏠 Property Listings Management

**Add Listings**
- Hosts can create listings with details such as:
  - Title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.

**Edit/Delete Listings**
- Hosts can update or delete their listings at any time.

---

### 3. 🔍 Search and Filtering

Implement search functionality with filters:
- **Location**
- **Price range**
- **Number of guests**
- **Amenities** (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly, etc.)

Include **pagination** for large result sets.

---

### 4. 📅 Booking Management

**Booking Creation**
- Guests can book a property for specific dates.
- Prevent double bookings through **date validation**.

**Booking Cancellation**
- Allow guests and hosts to cancel based on **cancellation policy**.

**Booking Status**
- Track booking status: `Pending`, `Confirmed`, `Canceled`, `Completed`.

---

### 5. 💳 Payment Integration

Integrate secure payment gateways such as **Stripe** or **PayPal** for:
- Guest payments.
- Automatic host payouts after successful bookings.

Support **multiple currencies** for global users.

---

### 6. ⭐ Reviews and Ratings

- Guests can leave **reviews** and **ratings** on properties.
- Hosts can respond to guest reviews.
- Reviews must be linked to completed bookings to prevent misuse.

---

### 7. 🔔 Notifications System

Send **email** and **in-app notifications** for:
- Booking confirmations
- Cancellations
- Payment updates

---

### 8. 🧑‍💼 Admin Dashboard

An admin panel to manage:
- Users
- Listings
- Bookings
- Payments

Admins can also monitor system performance and flag fraudulent activity.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### 1. 🗄️ Database Management

Use a relational database like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**.

**Required Tables:**
- `users` (guests, hosts, admins)
- `properties`
- `bookings`
- `reviews`
- `payments`

---

### 2. 🌐 API Development

- Develop **RESTful APIs** for frontend integration.
- Use correct HTTP methods and status codes:
  - `GET` – retrieve data  
  - `POST` – create data  
  - `PUT/PATCH` – update data  
  - `DELETE` – remove data

Optionally implement **GraphQL** for complex data fetching.

---

### 3. 🔒 Authentication & Authorization

- Use **JWT** for user session management.
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage permissions:
  - Guests  
  - Hosts  
  - Admins

---

### 4. 🖼️ File Storage

- Store **property images** and **profile photos** in cloud storage:
  - AWS S3, Cloudinary, or local file storage (for development).

---

### 5. 📤 Third-Party Services

- Use **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for sending transactional emails.

---

### 6. ⚙️ Error Handling & Logging

- Implement **global error handling** for API routes.
- Log critical errors and events for debugging and analytics.

---

## 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. ⚡ Scalability

- Use a **modular architecture** to support growth.
- Enable **horizontal scaling** with load balancers.

---

### 2. 🔐 Security

- Encrypt sensitive data (passwords, payment info).
- Implement **firewalls** and **rate limiting** to prevent brute-force attacks.

---

### 3. ⚙️ Performance Optimization

- Use **Redis caching** to speed up frequently accessed data (like search results).
- Optimize database queries for efficiency and reduced load.

---

### 4. 🧪 Testing

- Write **unit** and **integration tests** using frameworks such as **pytest**.
- Automate **API endpoint testing** to ensure consistent functionality.

---
